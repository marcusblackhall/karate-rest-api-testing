# Karate rest api testing demo

## Overview
With **karate** there is no need to use code your own calls
to the rest url as you can use a syntax in the feature file to execute and assert the results of the rest request.

The feature files follow the common Gherkin syntax. 

## Example

See feature file _users.feature_

## Running a feature file

See _UsersTest_ class. This is a Karate Junit 5 test class.

To run the test using maven ...

```aidl
mvn test
```
